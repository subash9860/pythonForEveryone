# Task
# To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

# You've got this!

# Note: The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, and the  variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

# Input Format

# A single line of text denoting  (the variable whose contents must be printed).

# Output Format

# Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of  on the second line.

# Sample Input

# Welcome to 30 Days of Code!
# Sample Output

# Hello, World. 
# Welcome to 30 Days of Code!

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
